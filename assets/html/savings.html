<h4>Potential Savings</h4>

<p> Based on the information provided we can assume that by automating your task we can free up <b>{{hours}} </b> hours
    over the course of a year. This is equivalent to you paying <b>{{ yearly_saving }}</b> for your staff to carry out
    this
    process each year. On top of negating this cost, the hours saved can be invested instead to generate value. Based on
    research carried out by <a

        and Legal</a>, we can estimate the revenue potential of these freed hours, using the average value a UK employee
    generates each year. Therefore, your potential increase in turnover from automating your process is
